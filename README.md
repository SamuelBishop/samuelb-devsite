# 🏔️ Samuel B. - Developer Portfolio

> Where software engineering meets mountain athletics - a portfolio built with the same precision and endurance that defines both crafts.

A fully responsive developer portfolio showcasing the intersection of technical excellence and mountain athlete mindset. Built with React and TypeScript, this site demonstrates clean code, performance optimization, and user-centric design principles.

## 🎯 Project Vision

This portfolio bridges two worlds: the logical precision of software engineering and the raw determination of mountain athletics. Every component is crafted with the same attention to detail I bring to both debugging complex systems and navigating challenging terrain.

**Target Audience**: Potential employers, collaborators, and the outdoor community who value both technical skills and adventure-driven mindset.
